Better text editing & copy/paste,Select text across multiple blocks,"We finally did it. Notion’s text editor has been completely retooled to combine the flexibility of “blocks” with the familiar feeling of a traditional word processor. Here’s what that means for you:
On desktop: Click & drag to select, cut, copy & paste partial text across paragraphs, bullet lists, callouts & more — without having to select each block in its entirety.
On mobile: Now you can select or copy/paste multiple items at once! Double tap to select text, and drag your selection to include content across multiple blocks.
Partial text selection across blocks will be supported on all platforms except Firefox. We’re actively working with the Mozilla team to enable this feature in Firefox as soon as possible.","January 8, 2022",1

New database permissions 🔒,Can Edit Content permission level,"Notion databases give you and your teammates a customizable place to track engineering sprints, company OKRs, content calendars and more. And now you have even more control over who can do what in a database.

Just open the Share menu of a database to get started.","February 8, 2022",2

Connect your tools with the API 🧰,The API is out of beta,"Since we launched the API into beta last year, over 30,000 people have joined our developer community, building everything from workflow automations and content publishing systems, to productivity tools and search aggregators, all on the Notion platform.
And for the last several months, we’ve been working hard to expand the API’s capabilities to make it even easier to build with Notion. Now the API is out of beta, and better than ever.

New API functionality and improved documentation: The API now supports even more block types, including synced blocks, multi-column pages, simple tables and more. We’ve also made the API more stable and reliable, and improved our documentation to make it easier for developers to build and test integrations.
New controls for admins (Enterprise Plan): Admins on an Enterprise Plan can now pre-approve specific integrations for use in their workspace, for more transparency and control. Admins can also view which integrations are being used in their workspace, who’s using them, and disconnect integrations for specific users.

Connect your tools with the API 🧰,Better dark mode,"Your Notion workspace is like a cozy living room, a place to hang out and get work done — and dark mode is like turning off the lights. It gives your space a different look and feel, and can be helpful with eye strain and readability too.
Now dark mode is even better! We updated the color palette to include deeper hues, higher contrast, and more saturated colors, keeping accessibility in mind throughout the redesign.

Advanced filters enable complex workflows. There when you need them, and out of sight when you don’t. Create nested filter groups up to three layers deep for endless possibilities.","March 15, 2022",3
"Notion 2.15, now with better databases",Create views from existing databases,"Create custom views to the same database across multiple pages. You’ll see a new option to select a data source whenever you add a new view, allowing you to embed custom synced copies of existing databases in your workspace.
Copy an existing view, instantly. After you select a data source, you’ll see a new menu containing all the existing views of that database. Hover on each to preview, then pick one to instantly recreate the view’s filters, sorts, grouping, property visibility & more.
Show content from multiple databases within a single view block. For example, one tab could display a view of your “Projects” database, while another pulls in data from a more granular “Tasks” database, unifying workflows that depend on multiple databases together.","March 15, 2022",3
"Notion 2.15, now with better databases",Streamlined new design,"Discover and switch views with tabs. Views let you and your team slice and dice data however you need. And now they’re just one click away — access different views with tabs at the top of each database.
Customize database views from a single menu. Before, view options were spread across multiple menus and dropdowns. Now they’re all accessible from one place, where you can change the view layout, visible properties, filters & sorts, grouping and more.
Hide the database title. Whether you’re creating a personal dashboard with a minimalist look, or trying to clean up your team’s homepage, now you have the option to hide the title of the source database in a linked view. A top feature request!","March 15, 2022",3
"Notion 2.15, now with better databases",Deeply nested sub-pages load 50% faster,"Notion supports an infinite hierarchy — that means you can store pages inside pages, inside pages, inside pages, forever. But we noticed that for pages that are nested more than a few levels deep, your experience becomes more sluggish.
Thanks to a few under-the-hood improvements, these pages now load and save over 50% faster. 57%, to be exact!","March 15, 2022",3
"Notion 2.16, now with faster databases",Large databases load 2.5× faster,"When you’re working with hundreds or thousands of docs or tasks, databases help you keep everything organized. But in the past, Notion’s servers would try to load the entire database all at once, making giant databases quite slow.
Now, your databases only load what you need, when you need it. As a result, large databases are more than twice as fast as before — and this improvement is even more noticeable on databases with over 1,000 rows.","April 14, 2022",4
"Notion 2.16, now with faster databases",Export filtered database views,"Databases can store huge quantities of content — and filters help you find what you need. But before, it was impossible to export a database without including all of its content, even if a filter was applied.
Now, you can export your filtered database views as PDF, HTML & CSV. Just click the ••• at the top right of your app, select Export, and choose “Current view” for the “Include databases” option","April 14, 2022",4
"Notion 2.16, now with faster databases",Wrap individual columns,"In your Table view databases, some cells can start to overflow with content — especially text & URL properties. You may want to “wrap” the cells to see all this content at a glance, or turn off wrapping to hide the overflowing content. But before, this option could only be applied to the entire database.
Now, you can customize text wrapping for each individual column. Just click on the column header, and you’ll see a new toggle to “Wrap column.”","April 14, 2022",4

"Notion 2.16, now with faster databases",Hover your cursor to see long titles that got cut off,"If your page titles or database property values are quite long, they’ll probably get cut off when you try to view them in various parts of the app. Now there are tooltips to see the full names of:
Menu items in some dropdown menus for quick filters, select & multi-select values
Related pages with long titles when you hover over relation property values when you’re in page view

Easier relation property setup,Easier relation property setup,"Relation properties make your databases even more powerful, helping you build workflows — like knowing which tasks are associated with certain projects.

Before, adding a relation always created two properties: one on each database. But you don’t always need the extra property. Now, you have the choice:
One property (default): Add items from Database B to Database A, without creating another property on Database B. Backlinks are added to the related pages on Database B to make navigation easy, without adding clutter.
Two properties (optional): After you add a relation, click the “Show on the other database” toggle to create another property on Database B, so you can see a list of related pages displayed on both databases.
Whether you’re creating a new relation or editing an existing one, it’s much easier to configure and visualize your relations to perfectly fit your workflow.","May 3, 2022",5

But while it’s useful to have everyone under the same roof, different teams need their own spaces, and the flexibility to change how you work as the company grows.

Teamspaces are like mini-workspaces within your workspace: custom sections of the sidebar that can be adapted to every company department, working group, cross-functional project, or whatever you need to get teams on the same page. And for the first time, every employee will be able to curate and customize their own view of the company’s Notion workspace, by joining the teamspaces relevant to their role and priorities (and leaving the ones that aren’t).
Click All teamspaces at the top of your sidebar to get started. Click the + New teamspace button to create a space for your department, office location, or working group, and join relevant teamspaces to add them to your sidebar.
Customize teamspaces to meet the needs of every team. Every teamspace can have its own look and feel, members & settings. Enterprise workspaces gain granular control over employees’ ability to publish pages to the web, export, and add guest collaborators, on a space-by-space basis.
New privacy settings and roles ensure that everyone has the appropriate level of access to content. Designate teamspace owners to control membership, security settings & permission levels.
